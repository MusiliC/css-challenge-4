                    looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing
                    experience here. I signed up for the free into course and found it incredibly
                    fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                    gruelling - time of my life. I've successfully switched careers, working as the
                    software engineer at the VS setup "

                    "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by former
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
                    its stuff did not disappoint. They were very hands on and i never had to wait for long for assistance
                    . The agile team project in particular was outstanding. It took my learning to te next level in a
                    way that no tutorial could ever done. In fact, i have often referred to it during interviews as an
                    example of y development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full stack developer
                    after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend "
